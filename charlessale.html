<p>My interests within architecture are climatic design and socially-conscious design (but I'm still working that out). I very much enjoy building architectural models. I have skills using Revit/Rhino/Adobe Suite. </p>
<h4>I am interested in acquiring part-time office experience during the 2020 university year.</h4>
